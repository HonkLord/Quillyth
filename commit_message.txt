refactor: Overhaul project and remove legacy code

This commit represents a major refactoring of the campaign-manager application.

Key changes:
- Replaced the entire content of the repository with the `campaign-manager` project.
- Removed hard-coded campaign IDs from both frontend and backend, making the application multi-campaign capable.
- Added a `/api/campaigns/current` endpoint to dynamically fetch the active campaign.
- Centralized frontend data fetching in `DataManager`.
- Eliminated redundant database table creation statements and consolidated them into a single initialization function.
- Removed dead-end UI elements and their corresponding placeholder functions (e.g., "manage events", "backup campaign", "reset campaign").
- Deleted unused AI-related placeholder functions from the character manager.
- Cleaned up `js/app.js` by removing unused DM tools, search functionality, and other legacy code.
- Fixed broken CSS imports pointing to a non-existent legacy directory.
