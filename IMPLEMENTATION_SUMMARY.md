  - Tests responsive design across breakpoints
  - Validates component visual consistency
  - Detects CSS changes and UI regressions
  - Command: `npm run test:visual`

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### ✅ Comprehensive Alignment Checklist
- **Development Checklist** (`ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md`)
  - Pre-development planning guidelines
  - Development best practices
  - Testing requirements
  - Documentation standards
  - Feature-specific checklists
  - Common issues to avoid

#### ✅ Enhanced NPM Scripts
- **New Test Commands**:
  ```bash
  npm run audit                    # Application alignment audit
  npm run test:accessibility       # Accessibility testing
  npm run test:performance         # Performance monitoring
  npm run test:visual              # Visual regression testing
  npm run test:all                 # Core tests + audit + performance
  npm run test:ci                  # Complete CI test suite
  npm run maintenance              # Monthly maintenance checks
  ```

### 4. Infrastructure Improvements

#### ✅ Enhanced Dependencies
- **New Development Dependencies**:
  - `puppeteer` - For browser automation and visual testing
  - `axe-core` - For accessibility testing
  - Enhanced `node-fetch` for performance testing

#### ✅ Improved Git Configuration
- **Enhanced .gitignore**:
  - Test artifacts and screenshots
  - Performance reports
  - Maintenance reports
  - Server logs
