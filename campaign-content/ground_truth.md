You are absolutely, 100% correct. I apologize. In my effort to update with the *latest* session (Session 9 details which included the centipede fight), I seem to have overwritten or failed to properly merge the incredibly detailed Ground Truth document we had just compiled which was accurate up to the *end of Session 8* (ending at the spider-guarded sewer grate).

My mistake. We need to take that comprehensive "End of Session 8" Ground Truth and *add* the events of Session 9 to it.

Let me do that now. I will take the massive, detailed Ground Truth document that ended with "Session 8: Web of Decay & Descent" and append a new "Session 9: The Taste of the Underbelly" summary, and update the character statuses to reflect the events of Session 9 (Finnick joining, Trickle met, chasm fight, arrival at Cistern threshold).

This will ensure *all* the rich detail is preserved and correctly updated.

## **II. The Ever-Spinning World: Codex of Eryndral**

### **A. Echoes of Creation & Scars of Time (Cosmology & Major Historical Events)**

1. **The World of Eryndral:**
    * The campaign world, a planet featuring diverse locales, ancient ruins, and lands shaped by conflict and divine influence. Known civilizations reside mainly on one major continent and its surrounding isles.
    * **Legends of Origin:** Vary – some claim gods once walked Eryndral directly, altering its landscapes and people to suit their designs. Others suggest Eryndral was forged from the remnants of an older, shattered realm, leaving behind pockets of wild magic and domains steeped in ancient curses.
2. **The War of the Deathless (A Cataclysm Remembered):**
    * A cataclysmic conflict that ravaged The Cymrath Dominion, initiated by the arch-necromancer **Malrik the Deathless**.
    * **Malrik's Rise:** Originally a mortal mage of humble origins who lost his family to famine, Malrik became obsessed with conquering death. He delved into forbidden necromantic arts, achieving unparalleled mastery. Legends claim he bargained with dark gods or tapped into ancient, primal forces. He was empowered significantly by the rumored **Black Chalice**, an artifact fabled to amplify necromantic power a hundredfold, allowing him to raise entire cities of the dead overnight and amass a vast undead horde.
    * **Phases & Key Events of the Undead Conquest:**
        * *The Silent March:* Malrik's initial campaign, where small towns and isolated villages fell without warning to silent armies emerging under moonlight, their populations killed indiscriminately and added to his forces.
        * *The Nightfall Offensive:* Malrik unleashed his most terrifying creations – **Death Titans**, massive undead amalgamations built from countless corpses – which crushed the Dominion’s largest border fortresses.
        * *The Siege of Ironmoor:* The heavily fortified dwarven city in the Northern Reaches held out for months but ultimately fell when Malrik poisoned its water supply with potent necrotic energy. Survivors fled, many towards Duskhaven, carrying tales of horror. ([Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar) fought here and was turned into a vampire servant by [Jezebel](#jezebel) to survive her mortal wounds).
        * *The Sorrow of Eldwyne:* The prosperous coastal city was overrun in a single night, its defenders transformed into spectral wraiths. Eldwyne's grand lighthouse was corrupted into a beacon of despair, its light shifting to a sickly green glow.
        * *The Black Harvest:* In a desperate attempt to starve Malrik’s army, Dominion forces razed fields and poisoned granaries. Malrik mocked their efforts by animating the dead from the very ashes.
        * *The Pact of Duskhaven:* In the war’s final, desperate years, leaders from across the fragmented Dominion convened in the burgeoning city of Duskhaven to form an unprecedented coalition against Malrik, marking a rare moment of unity.
    * **The Fall of Malrik:**
        * **Battleground:** The final, legendary confrontation occurred in the region that would become known as the **Ashen Vale**.
        * **The Coalition (The Heroes of the Vale):** This alliance of heroes and armies, outnumbered but determined, lured Malrik's forces into a narrow valley, neutralizing his numerical advantage. Key figures included:
            * **King Aldred the Bold:** A human warrior-king who led charges against Malrik's Death Titans.
            * **Seraphina Lirieth:** An elven archmage who countered Malrik’s necromantic spells. She ultimately sacrificed her own life force by unleashing a devastating spell that destroyed Malrik's physical form.
            * **Thane Torgrin Stoneheart:** A dwarven commander who heroically held the Vale’s northern pass for days, allowing reinforcements to arrive.
            * **Veyra of the Wilds:** A halfling druid who summoned the land's primal forces to battle Malrik’s undead legions.
        * **The Lingering Mystery of Malrik's Defeat:** While Seraphina Lirieth destroyed Malrik's physical form, the *exact nature* of her spell and what truly happened to Malrik's ultimate essence or his phylactery remains a subject of scholarly debate and fearful speculation. It is widely known and feared that **Malrik's traditional phylactery was never found**.
    * **The War's Enduring Scars:**
        * **The Ashen Vale:** The site of Malrik’s fall remains a cursed, desolate wasteland. Its soil is blackened, its skies perpetually gray, and travelers report hearing faint screams carried on the wind. It is avoided by most.
        * **Undead Remnants:** Malrik’s army did not vanish with his physical death. Significant pockets of leaderless undead, and perhaps some minor lieutenants, still roam the wilderness, particularly in the Eastern Wilds and blighted regions, forming a constant threat.
        * **The Black Chalice:** The artifact that empowered Malrik disappeared during the chaos of the final battle, its whereabouts unknown, fueling endless speculation and desire among dark cultists.
        * **Myths of Malrik’s Return:** The unrecovered phylactery and his unconfirmed true death give rise to persistent whispers that his spirit lingers, biding its time until conditions are ripe for his return. Cults devoted to "The Deathless" occasionally surface, seeking to bring about his dark resurrection.
3. **The Hollow Reconstruction (An Age of Broken Promises):**
    * The tumultuous era following Malrik's defeat. A fleeting dawn of peace quickly succumbed to the shadows of corruption, mismanagement, and the slow decay of unified purpose within the Cymrath Dominion.
    * **Defining Events:**
        * *The Heroes’ Disbanding:* The surviving champions of the Vale were lavished with titles, lands, and wealth. However, their subsequent rivalries, ambitions, and often selfish pursuits fractured the political landscape, sowing seeds of instability and resentment.
        * *The Great Culling:* A wave of paranoia and fear swept the Dominion. Zealous purges targeted suspected necromancers, sorcerers, and even innocent scholars accused of harboring forbidden knowledge, devastating the magical community and driving much arcane knowledge into secrecy or oblivion.
        * *The Warlord Boom:* Powerful mercenary commanders and grizzled war veterans, unwilling to disband their hardened armies and accustomed to power, carved out personal fiefdoms, extorting tributes and establishing their own brutal rule across various territories. This era saw the genesis of formidable mercenary companies like **The Iron Brand**.
    * **The People's Memory:** For the common folk, the Hollow Reconstruction is a bitter memory of hope betrayed, promises of rebuilding unfulfilled, and the rise of new oppressors. For the nobility and those who profited, it is often romanticized as an age of necessary sacrifice and the forging of a new order, further deepening the chasm between the rulers and the ruled.
4. **The Necrotic Heart (Malrik's True Phylactery/Legacy - *DM Internal Lore, Potentially Emerging for Players*):**
    * Unknown to most, Malrik, in his final moments or as a contingency, channeled the vast majority of his malevolent essence and undying will into an immensely powerful artifact known as the **Necrotic Heart**. This artifact effectively serves as his true, ultimate phylactery or a potent seed for his eventual return or the re-empowerment of his dark legacy across Eryndral.
    * This dark artifact was either lost in the cataclysm of the final battle or was deliberately hidden by Malrik's most trusted servants deep beneath the earth, in the very lands upon which the sprawling city of Duskhaven would later be founded.
    * Its immense, dormant power *leaks* subtly but persistently, like a slow, seeping poison. This leakage contributes significantly to the pervasive necromantic taint, the unnatural animation of undeath, the spiritual corruption that festers within The Hollow, and the strange disturbances in the deeper, forgotten regions beneath Duskhaven.
    * The establishment of the **Sunshield Ward** by the Gilded Spire was likely, at least in part, a desperate measure by those early founders of Duskhaven or later powers who became aware (or suspected the existence) of this terrifying subterranean threat. The Ward was designed to contain its malevolent influence and suppress the powerful undead manifestations it could empower or attract.
    * **Kaelen**, the sentient spirit within [Geoff's Artifact](#geoffs-artifact), being one of Malrik's former lieutenants, is intrinsically aware of the Necrotic Heart and its supreme significance. His ultimate goal is to locate it, believing it can either fully resurrect Malrik or grant him (and by extension, Geoff) god-like necromantic power.

### **B. Key World Lore Figures**

1. **Malrik the Deathless:**
    * **Status:** Physical Form Destroyed (by Seraphina Lirieth at the Ashen Vale); True Essence likely tied to the **Necrotic Heart**; Traditional Phylactery (if any other existed) Missing and presumed less significant.
    * **Epithets:** The Pale Sovereign, The Wound of Cymrath, The Harbinger of Silence.
    * **Legacy:** The arch-necromancer who initiated the War of the Deathless, reshaping the history of the Cymrath Dominion. His ultimate defeat is a celebrated fact, but the true nature of his lingering power and the means of his potential return are dangerous secrets.

### **C. Religion & Deities (Pantheon of Eryndral)**

* The deities of Eryndral embody the world's inherent duality of hope and despair, creation and destruction. While clerics often dedicate themselves to a specific patron deity, reverence for the pantheon as a whole, or at least acknowledgment of its various powers, is common. Tales also speak of a **Forgotten Pantheon**, ancient gods whose worship has faded into obscurity or active suppression, their few remaining followers often branded as dangerous cultists or heretics.
* **Lyris, Goddess of Light and Redemption:**
  * **Domains:** Life, Light.
  * **Symbol:** A radiant sunburst, often depicted with gentle, outreaching rays.
  * **Worshippers:** Healers, paladins of mercy, those seeking forgiveness or a path away from darkness, idealists clinging to hope in bleak times, and communities blessed by sunlight.
* **Kaelthar, God of Knowledge and Secrets:**
  * **Domains:** Knowledge, Arcana.
  * **Symbol:** An open book, its pages filled with complex runes, with a single, unblinking, all-seeing eye at its center.
  * **Worshippers:** Scholars, mages, librarians, spies, detectives, and all who seek hidden truths, forgotten lore, or the power that knowledge brings.
* **Durnok, God of Stone and Endurance:**
  * **Domains:** Forge, War (specifically defensive war, fortitude).
  * **Symbol:** A mighty, unadorned hammer striking a glowing anvil, sparks flying.
  * **Worshippers:** Miners, smiths, engineers, soldiers, guardians, and all who value strength, resilience, craftsmanship, and the enduring power of stone and metal. Particularly revered in the mountain fortress of [Ironmoor](#ironmoor).
* **Valtheris, God of Shadows and Ambition:**
  * **Domains:** Trickery, Twilight.
  * **Symbol:** A sharply defined crescent moon, its points needle-sharp, partially veiled by swirling, indistinct clouds or shadows.
  * **Worshippers:** Rogues, assassins, illusionists, ambitious nobles, keepers of dangerous secrets, spies, and all who thrive in the spaces between light and dark, using deception and cunning as their tools. ([Lilith Agnar's](#lilith-agnar) chosen deity; her Daywalker ability is understood by her as a subtle blessing or protection from his domain, allowing her to mock the sun's power).
* **Myreth, Goddess of Nature and Change:**
  * **Domains:** Nature, Tempest.
  * **Symbol:** A vibrant green leaf, perfect in its form, perfectly encased within a shard of clear, unmelting ice, symbolizing the balance of growth and stasis, life and harsh reality.
  * **Worshippers:** Druids, rangers, farmers, hunters, and all who respect the cycles of the natural world, the power of the wilderness, and the inevitability of transformation and elemental fury.
* **Tormath, God of Death and Balance:**
  * **Domains:** Death, Grave.
  * **Symbol:** A skeletal hand, bone-white and stark, holding a pair of perfectly balanced scales, signifying justice and the impartial nature of death.
  * **Worshippers:** Undertakers, judges, philosophers contemplating mortality, guardians of tombs, and those who revere the sanctity and inevitability of death as a necessary part of the natural order and the great cycle.
* **Vorlag, the Suffocating Void (Ashen Veil Deity):**
  * An entity of the Forgotten Pantheon, or perhaps something even older and more alien. Vorlag represents entropy, absolute decay, oblivion, the crushing silence between stars, and the ultimate, consuming hunger that lies at the end of all things.
  * **Worship:** Its followers, the **Ashen Veil**, believe all existence is a fleeting, painful illusion before the inevitable and desirable return to the perfect silence of the Void. They seek to hasten this "Great Unmaking" or to appease Vorlag's insatiable hunger with sacrifices of souls, flesh, fear, and even hope itself, believing this might earn them a place of honor in the final emptiness or perhaps simply a quicker, less agonizing dissolution.
  * **Symbol:** A tightening, inward-spiraling vortex, often drawn in blood, ash, or bone dust.
  * **Influence:** Strongest in places of profound decay, despair, and death, such as The Hollow. Its presence is felt as a soul-crushing emptiness, a life-draining cold, and a silence that deafens all other sound and thought.

### **D. Geography & Nations: The Cymrath Dominion**

1. **Overview:** Once a proud and mighty realm that stood as a beacon against the darkness, the Cymrath Dominion is now a shadow of its former self, struggling under the weight of fractured governance, widespread corruption, economic hardship, and the deep, unhealed scars left by the War of the Deathless. While it nominally claims authority over a vast continent of diverse climates and biomes, its practical reach is tenuous, with many regions facing their own slow, inexorable decline or operating with near-total autonomy, paying only lip service to the central authority.
2. **Governance - The Aristocratic Council:** The Dominion is nominally ruled by this council, a body composed of six representatives from its major historical regions. However, their authority is severely fragmented by deep-seated rivalries, ancient grudges, and the overwhelming tendency of each member to prioritize their local interests and personal power above the welfare of the Dominion as a whole. Council meetings are often characterized by political maneuvering, empty rhetoric, and stalemates.
    * **High Chancellor Elreth Vayne:** (High Elf) An ancient, wizened figure, Elreth Vayne is more a symbol of a bygone era of elven influence than a true wielder of power. She presides over council meetings with weary grace, often acting as a mediator but lacking the authority to enforce unity.
    * **Lord Arneld of Eldwyne:** (Human) A pragmatic and shrewd merchant lord from the prosperous (if increasingly isolated) coastal city of Eldwyne. He cares little for the Dominion's internal squabbles, focusing instead on maintaining Eldwyne's lucrative trade routes and neutrality.
    * **Thane Karvek Stonebreaker of Ironmoor:** (Dwarf) The gruff, fiercely independent ruler of the mountain fortress-city of Ironmoor. He values his city's autonomy above all else and views the council (especially Duskhaven's influence) with deep suspicion and undisguised contempt.
    * **Lady Anora Thistledown of Lowfields:** (Human) An outwardly charming but ruthlessly self-serving aristocrat representing the once-verdant Lowfields. She is notorious for exploiting her region's agricultural resources and peasant labor for her own personal enrichment and political gain.
    * **Duke Lareth Thornwell of Duskhaven:** (Human) The current representative for Duskhaven. Known throughout the Dominion for his opulent decadence, blatant corruption, and largely ineffective leadership. He is more concerned with maintaining his lavish lifestyle and navigating Duskhaven's treacherous internal politics than with matters of state.
    * **Mystic Deyrala of Veilcairn:** (Tiefling) An enigmatic and reclusive figure representing the secretive southern settlement of Veilcairn. She rarely attends council meetings in person, often sending cryptic messages or proxies. Rumors abound of her dabbling in forbidden magics and her ties to the strange powers emanating from the nearby Blighted Woods.
3. **Key Regions/Biomes of the Cymrath Dominion:**
    * **The Central Heartlands:** Once the fertile breadbasket of the Dominion, these rolling plains and gentle hills are now often controlled by corrupt absentee landlords, plagued by banditry, or left fallow due to over-taxation and collapsing infrastructure.
    * **The Northern Reaches:** A harsh land of rugged, snow-capped mountains and cold, windswept valleys. Home to resilient mining communities and fortress cities like [Ironmoor](#ironmoor).
    * **The Western Coasts:** A region of dramatic rocky cliffs, temperate rainforests, and numerous natural harbors. Location of the port city of [Eldwyne](#eldwyne) and several smaller, independent trading posts. Relatively prosperous but wary of Dominion entanglements.
    * **The Southern Expanse:** Vast, arid lowlands characterized by sprawling deserts, salt flats, and sparse scrublands. Home to nomadic tribes and isolated, hardy settlements like [Veilcairn](#veilcairn), which lies near the edge of the dreaded Blighted Woods.
    * **The Eastern Wilds:** A sprawling expanse of dense, ancient forests, treacherous swamps, and mist-shrouded wetlands. Largely untamed and dangerous, partly reclaimed by nature after the War of the Deathless, and rumored to harbor significant pockets of undead remnants and forgotten horrors. Few active, sanctioned settlements remain.
    * **The Ashen Vale:** A vast, cursed wasteland situated in what was once the heart of the Dominion. The site of Malrik's final defeat, its soil is perpetually blackened, its skies an oppressive grey, and the very air is said to carry the faint screams of the countless dead. It is a place of profound desolation and lingering necromantic evil, avoided by all but the most desperate or foolish.

### **E. Major Locations & Current Events**

1. **Duskhaven:**
    * **Current Status & Overview:** The largest and arguably most influential (if decadent) city in the Cymrath Dominion. A former jewel of trade, culture, and innovation, Duskhaven now epitomizes the Dominion's slow, grinding decline. It is a city of stark, brutal contrasts: the unimaginable wealth and opulence of the Gilded Spire casting long, dark shadows over the crushing poverty and despair of the Rust Quarter and The Maw. Officially governed by **Duke Lareth Thornwell** and **The Council of Duskhaven** (a local body, distinct from the Dominion's Aristocratic Council, composed of six members representing nobility, powerful merchant guilds, and the clergy). In reality, power is diffuse, contested by factions, and often bought or seized through force or intrigue. A pervasive culture of denial, blissful ignorance, and mismanagement festers among the elite in the Spire, while the lower districts simmer with resentment and desperation. Duskhaven exerts (or attempts to exert) regional power over surrounding territories, such as the recently annexed and razed hamlet of [Briarhallow](#briarhallow). Warlock activity and other unsanctioned magic use is highly secretive and dangerous due to the watchful eyes of both official authorities and powerful criminal elements. [Vincent Martinelli's](#vincent-martinelli) Archfey Patron, **Lyraelle, the Twilight Bloom**, has indicated that her influence and ability to perceive events within Duskhaven are being significantly blocked or severed by some unknown interference, a primary motivator for Vincent's current endeavors. The party arrived in **The Maw** district via a stolen ferry raft at the end of Session 6 / start of Session 7. They subsequently evaded a confrontation with **Inquisitors of Duskhaven** in Fishgut Alley, battled and defeated Giant Spider guardians at a sewer grate near an abandoned fishery, and are currently (end of Session 9) at the **Unstable Bridge** leading towards the **Old Cistern** within **The Hollow**.
    * **The Sunshield Ward:** A potent, city-wide (or at least covering all major surface districts and extending somewhat into the upper Hollow) abjuration ward. It is projected from the **Gilded Spire**, with its focal point likely being the **Ivory Cathedral** or a dedicated arcane edifice within that district. This magical radiance actively suppresses powerful undeath, weakens ambient necromantic energies, and makes it exceedingly difficult for significant undead threats (like vampires, wraiths, potent ghouls) to manifest or operate openly, especially during daylight hours. It is considered Duskhaven's primary magical defense against the lingering horrors from the War of the Deathless and, more secretly, the insidious influence of the **Necrotic Heart** believed to be dormant deep beneath the city. The **Order of the Redeemed** (and its elite VR sect) are likely deeply involved in the maintenance, study, and enforcement of this Ward. [Lilith Agnar's](#lilith-agnar) Daywalker ability interacts uniquely with this Ward, her Valtheris-blessed shadow magic seemingly able to deflect or absorb its suppressive qualities.
    * **Key Districts (Detailed Status):**
        * **The Gilded Spire:** The glittering, elevated uppermost district of Duskhaven, home to the city's absolute elite, ancient noble houses, and most powerful institutions. A district of breathtaking (if often soulless) architecture, manicured gardens, private security forces, and pervasive, deeply ingrained corruption.
            * **Notable Locations:** The **Council Chambers** (where the Council of Duskhaven meets), lavish **Noble Estates** (including that of **Baron Enoch Hollowgrave**, known for arcane experimentation and implicated in the Briarhallow conspiracy), the grand **Ivory Cathedral**.
            * **Key Organizations:** **The Council of Duskhaven** (ruling body), **The Gilded Circle** (an elite, secretive cabal of nobles and merchants manipulating city finances and politics, led by **Guildmaster Varrick Hallow**), **The Ivory Cathedral** (the city's primary religious institution, led by **High Cleric Elspeth Crane**, who favors the Iron Brand for "peacekeeping").
            * **Key Figures:** **Lord Arcturus Draymoor** (influential councilor, allied with Varrick Hallow), **High Cleric Elspeth Crane**, **Guildmaster Varrick Hallow**, **Baron Enoch Hollowgrave**.
            * **Atmosphere:** Opulence masking decay, political intrigue, whispered scandals, strict social hierarchy, heavy guard presence (both private and Iron Brand). Source of the **Sunshield Ward**.
        * **The Shattered Crescent:** A bustling, chaotic district of innovation, trade, skilled artisans, and rampant espionage. It's a place where new technologies (often unstable, sometimes referred to as "clockwork" though more likely magi-tech) and magical theories are born, and where secrets are a valuable currency.
            * **Notable Locations:** Workshops of the **Clockworks Guild**, the under-resourced barracks of the **Duskhaven Militia (Middle Command)**, hidden safehouses of the **Crimson Quill**.
            * **Key Organizations:** **Clockworks Guild** (inventors and tinkerers creating magi-tech wonders and black-market goods, led by **Master Engineer Tessa Falk**), **Duskhaven Militia (Middle Command)** (city guard led by **Captain Bramwell Vance**, resents the Iron Brand), **Crimson Quill** (clandestine spy network, key operative: **"Red" Alina Vayne**).
            * **Atmosphere:** Constant noise of arcane machinery and commerce, smell of alchemical reagents and metal, crowded streets, a sense of desperate innovation mixed with equal parts opportunity and danger.
        * **The Rust Quarter:** The largest and most squalid of Duskhaven's lower districts. A sprawling maze of decaying tenements, failing manufactories, polluted canals, and desperate, downtrodden populace. Crime is rampant, and life is cheap.
            * **Notable Locations:** **The Chained Market** (a massive, chaotic black market bazaar where anything can be bought or sold, key contact: **Bergen "Ratcatcher" Nils**), **Grint’s Protection Kiosk** (Iron Brand extortion checkpoint), **The Iron Brand Barracks (The Brand's Forge)** (local HQ), **The Rusted Gauntlet** (notorious tavern and brutal fighting pit), **The Salt-Crusted Wharf** (dilapidated, smuggler-frequented docks), the partially submerged **Sunken Chapel of Tormath** (a place of quiet despair and grim faith), and **The Widow's Web** (Kezra Thorne's heavily guarded, hidden Ebon Syndicate safehouse).
            * **Key Organizations:** **The Iron Brand** (enforce brutal "order," local commander: **Marshal Kael Grint**; overall leader: **Grand Commander Viktor Karstheim**), **The Ebon Syndicate** (dominant crime family, led by **Kezra "The Widow" Thorne**).
            * **Atmosphere:** Oppressive poverty, despair, constant threat of violence and extortion, smell of rust, decay, and industrial pollutants.
        * **The Maw:** Duskhaven's sprawling, lawless docklands and industrial zone, situated at the mouth of the Blackwater River. A place of constant activity, unregulated factories belching smoke, dangerous warehouses, and the pervasive influence of pirates, smugglers, and brutal gangs.
            * **Notable Locations:** Countless wharves and piers (including **Gutterslip Dock** where faction fights are common), towering, grimy warehouses, raucous dockside taverns (like "The Drowned Rat"), polluting factories. **Gully's Tackle** shop. The **abandoned fishery** near the sewer grate entrance to The Hollow. Fishgut Alley.
            * **Key Organizations:** **The Sable Chain** (pirate and smuggler coalition led by **Captain Saria Blacktide**), **The Smokehouse Guild** (a "merchant consortium" acting as a massive smuggling front, led by **Kellan Myre**), **Duskhaven Docksmen Union** (a weak but resilient labor group led by **Old Gus Finn**).
            * **Atmosphere:** Constant noise, smell of brine, fish, industrial waste, and cheap ale. Lawlessness, danger, opportunity for illicit dealings. The party first arrived here.
        * **The Hollow:** A dangerous, multi-leveled subterranean network of ancient sewers, forgotten crypts, pre-city ruins, and natural caverns that lies beneath much of Duskhaven. It is a shadowy realm unto itself, a haven for outcasts, dangerous cults, monstrous creatures, and those seeking to operate far from the city's surface laws and the Spire's light.
            * **Known Factions within The Hollow:**
                * **Ashen Veil:** Death cult worshipping **Vorlag, the Suffocating Void**. Their overall leader in Duskhaven is **Prophetess Lyssa Morane**. A cell of three initiates encountered by the party near the Hollow entrance was manipulated into ritual suicide by [Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar). They practice soul-siphoning rituals and profane offerings.
                * **Hollow Brotherhood:** A loose and violent confederation of various gangs, brutal thugs, scavengers, and outlaws. Rork's crew, which controlled a checkpoint near the entrance, was recently eliminated by the party and Finnick. **Grusk Bone-Knapper** is another known enforcer, reportedly controlling access to the Serpent Coils. **Grisha "The Chain"** is rumored to be a more significant and ruthless boss deeper within. **Jarrek "The Mole" Calder** is a known (if unreliable) Halfling guide and informant who sometimes works with Brotherhood elements as well as the Crimson Quill.
                * **Shadow Wardens:** A clandestine and ruthless group dedicated to hunting supernatural threats and aberrations emerging from the deepest parts of The Hollow. Led by the formidable **Inquisitor Veylin Kross** (Goliath with Stone Giant ancestry). They are particularly obsessed with hunting and eradicating the Ashen Veil, seeing them as a major destabilizing force. Rumored to have recently captured a sun-resistant Drow (potential [Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar) lead). Their exact connection to the surface "VR" Inquisitors is currently unknown.
            * **Known Locations & Party Progress within The Hollow:**
                * **Sewer Entrance (near Abandoned Fishery, Maw):** The party's point of entry. Guarded by Giant Spiders which they defeated.
                * **Ashen Veil Shrine (Upper Hollow, near entrance):** Small ritual chamber where Lilith manipulated 3 cultists into suicide.
                * **Rork's Crew Checkpoint (Upper Hollow, near entrance):** Site of the battle where Rork and his thugs were killed by the party and Finnick.
                * **Polluted Drainage Culvert ("Maw-Pipe"):** A major outflow of surface pollution. Where [Vandarith](#vandarith) made first contact with and aided **Trickle (Water Sprite)**.
                * **Fungal Spore Cloud Area ("Yellow Lung"):** A tunnel section choked with hazardous yellow fungi, navigated by the party with some difficulty (Lilith and Geoff affected).
                * **Unstable Bridge over Chasm:** The party has just crossed this treacherous bridge, defeating an ambush of Giant Centipedes after a heroic rescue of Finnick. The **Old Cistern** lies immediately beyond this point.
                * **(Rumored/Upcoming for Session 10):** The **Old Cistern** (a vast, ancient, partially flooded water reserve, rumored to hold secrets of the old Shadowed Veil and elemental disturbances. Contains POIs: Central Pillar/Valve, Sunken Archway, Fungal Grove/Grave, Whispering Falls, and Mara Vane's presumed hideout - "The Overlook"/Concealed Fissure). Deeper areas include the **Serpent Coils** (Brotherhood/Syndicate tunnels), the **Ebony Stair** ([Geoff's](#geoff-wembley) Syndicate target location), the **Fungal Maze**, and the **Bone Orchard & Sunken Temple** (Ashen Veil stronghold).
2. **Briarhallow:** (Status: Razed to the ground by Duskhaven forces). Formerly a small, quiet hamlet and waystation near Duskhaven, situated between fertile plains and swampy lowlands. It was ruled fairly by **Lord Aurelius Davencourt** (now captured by Duskhaven, accused of treason and awaiting a show trial). This was the location of [Lilith Agnar's](#lilith-agnar) clinic with [Jezebel](#jezebel) before its destruction. The razing of Briarhallow by Duskhaven forces (implicating nobles like **Baron Enoch Hollowgrave**, Lady Camilla Castellan, Lord Garreth Avencine, Countess Maridia Blackwood, and Lady Tessa Morell) served as the inciting incident for the campaign, leading to the party's initial capture. Former landmarks included **Davencourt Manor**, a **Central Square**, and a **Riverside Mill**.
3. **Marshlight Crossing:** (Status: Utterly Destroyed, submerged ruins). Formerly a rickety stilt-hamlet located in treacherous swamp territory along the Blackwater River, it served as a tense outpost jointly occupied by a small Duskhaven guard detachment and a local lizardfolk tribe. In Session 5, [Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar) and [Vandarith](#vandarith) discovered an elemental rift chamber hidden beneath an overgrown shrine. By manipulating ritual pillars within, they deliberately and catastrophically unleashed the elemental plane of water through this rift. The resulting deluge, combined with a stampede of hippos from the nearby **Hippo Lagoon**, obliterated the settlement and is presumed to have killed all its inhabitants, including the lizardfolk leaders **Sovereign Narshka** and **Shaman Zathaar** (whose trident Vandarith recovered). The area is now nothing but submerged wreckage and violently altered, flooded swamp.
4. **Gully's Tackle:** A small, grimy shop dealing in fishing equipment and scavenged goods, located in **The Maw** district of Duskhaven. Run by the gaunt human **Gully**. The party sold Hestor Fairwind's magical oar here for 175 GP and received information leading them to Silas "Slick" Fenn.

### **F. Notable Factions & Organizations within Duskhaven**

* **The Ashen Veil:** (Primary Base: The Hollow, specifically rumored to be the Sunken Temple in the Bone Orchard). A secretive and fanatical death cult worshipping **Vorlag, the Suffocating Void**. Led in Duskhaven by **Prophetess Lyssa Morane**. They practice soul-siphoning rituals, make gruesome sacrifices, and believe in hastening the "Great Unmaking." They are known to collaborate with **The Ebon Syndicate**. A small cell of three initiates encountered by the party near the Hollow entrance was manipulated into ritual suicide by [Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar). They are actively hunted by **The Shadow Wardens**. Lyraelle, [Vincent's](#vincent-martinelli) patron, identifies their rituals as a source of magical interference.
* **The Ebon Syndicate:** (Primary Base: Rust Quarter - The Widow's Web; significant presence in The Hollow). Duskhaven's dominant and most sophisticated crime family, led by the enigmatic Drow **Kezra "The Widow" Thorne**. They are involved in smuggling, racketeering, assassination, political corruption, and illicit trades throughout the city. Their influence extends city-wide, with a particularly strong grip on the Rust Quarter. They are known to collaborate with the **Ashen Veil** (specifically Prophetess Lyssa Morane). They take a significant cut from **The Chained Market** and use **The Widow's Web** as a lavish, hidden safehouse. They employed smugglers like the now-deceased **Ardin Claymoor**. **[Geoff Wembley](#geoff-wembley)** is a former bookkeeper who betrayed them (or was betrayed by them) and now seeks vengeance. Kaelen, the spirit in Geoff's artifact, directs him to their hidden site, the **Ebony Stair**, in The Hollow, believing it holds power and secrets. The Syndicate is rumored to be backed by the Fiend **Zathrax the Ember Tyrant**.
* **The Hollow Brotherhood:** (Primary Base: Dispersed throughout The Hollow). A loose and violent confederation of various gangs, brutal thugs, desperate scavengers, and opportunistic outlaws. They are not a unified force but rather a collection of crews vying for territory, resources (like Gloom Fungus farms or scavenging rights), and dominance through intimidation and violence. Rork's crew, which controlled a checkpoint near the Hollow entrance, was recently eliminated by the party and Finnick. **Grusk Bone-Knapper** is another known enforcer, reportedly controlling access to the Serpent Coils. **Grisha "The Chain"** is rumored to be a more significant and ruthless boss deeper within. **Jarrek "The Mole" Calder** is a known (if unreliable) Halfling guide and informant who sometimes works with Brotherhood elements as well as the Crimson Quill.
* **Inquisitors of Duskhaven (Order of the Redeemed / Vigilant Redeemers - VR):**
  * A formidable, disciplined, and well-equipped holy order operating with apparent high authority within Duskhaven, dedicated to hunting and purging undead, heretics, and practitioners of dark magic. They appear to be the primary enforcers of the **Sunshield Ward's** integrity.
  * Known members encountered: **Sera Valen** (a stern female leader, likely a Knight or battle-cleric archetype, wielding a glaive, uses holy water/oils, has items for *Detect Evil and Good* and *Guiding Bolt*) and **Kaelis Varr** (her silent, imposing VR-marked enforcer, likely a Gladiator or heavy warrior type with a greatsword, Sunlight Pellets, and extreme zeal).
  * They possess a **Seeker's Compass** for tracking potent undead on the surface (its effectiveness is nullified by the magical interference and sheer density of energies within The Hollow).
  * They confronted the party in Fishgut Alley in The Maw, investigating "dark disturbances" and "undead abominations" following the events at Marshlight and the party's arrival. [Acolyte Isshara](#acolyte-isshara) was explosively killed when Geoff used her as a human shield against Sera Valen's divine smite. The party fled/evaded them in the ensuing shock and horror.
  * The "VR" symbol is identical to the one borne by the Inquisitor who killed [Jezebel](#jezebel), making them a primary target for [Lilith Agnar's](#lilith-agnar) vengeance. The full name of the order (**Order of the Redeemed**) and its elite sect (**Vigilant Redeemers - VR**), along with its leadership (potentially **Avanar Voss**, Lilith's unknown brother), are DM lore, not yet fully known to the party.
* **The Iron Brand:** (Primary Base: Rust Quarter - The Brand's Forge). Duskhaven's largest and most notoriously brutal mercenary company. Led by the calculating **Grand Commander Viktor Karstheim** (Human, based near the Gilded Spire). They enforce "order" throughout the city, particularly in the Rust Quarter (where their local commander is **Marshal Kael Grint**, an Orc), through extortion, violence, and intimidation, operating with impunity under lucrative contracts from Duskhaven's nobility and wealthy clients, including the Ivory Cathedral. They are known for establishing extortion checkpoints like **Grint's Protection Kiosk**.
* **Shadowed Veil:** [Vincent Martinelli's](#vincent-martinelli) former syndicate. Once a significant player in Duskhaven's underworld, specializing in secrets, infiltration, and perhaps more subtle forms of crime than the Ebon Syndicate. Believed to have been largely destroyed or scattered some time ago, primarily due to a violent purge by the **Ashen Veil**. Vincent seeks to find any surviving members (rumors, via Finnick, point to a **Mara Vane** potentially hiding with a small cell near the Old Cistern) and rebuild the organization under his leadership, guided and supported by his patron Lyraelle.
* **The Shadow Wardens:** (Primary Base: Deeper sections of The Hollow). A clandestine, highly disciplined, and ruthless group led by the formidable **Inquisitor Veylin Kross** (Goliath with Stone Giant ancestry). They claim to protect Duskhaven from ancient supernatural threats and powerful aberrations emerging from the deepest, unexplored parts of The Hollow, particularly obsessed with hunting and eradicating the Ashen Veil. Rumored to have recently captured a sun-resistant Drow (a potential lead for or about [Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar)). Their exact methods, full numbers, and relationship to the surface "VR" Inquisitors are currently unknown.
* **(Other Surface Factions from Gilded Spire, Shattered Crescent, Maw – Gilded Circle, Ivory Cathedral, Clockworks Guild, Crimson Quill, Sable Chain, Smokehouse Guild, Docksmen Union, Duskhaven Militia – exist as established background powers within the city, with their key figures and traits as previously detailed. The party has not yet had significant direct interaction with most of these, beyond those encountered in The Maw or mentioned in relation to other factions.)**

### **H. Key NPCs (Active or Recently Deceased)**

* **Finnick the Scavenger:**
  * **Status:** Active, currently guiding the party.
  * **Description:** (Human Commoner). Rail-thin, dressed in filthy rags, perpetually terrified but surprisingly resilient and resourceful. Has a keen eye for survival in The Hollow.
  * **History:** Was being tormented by Rork's Hollow Brotherhood crew when the party intervened. Bravely (and effectively) stabbed Rork in the back with a poisoned blade during the fight. Pledged loyalty (out of fear and gratitude) to the party and is now their guide through the upper sections of The Hollow. Knows basic routes, common dangers, and local rumors. Witnessed the party's full brutality (Isshara's death, burning bodies) and Lilith's manipulation of the Ashen Veil. Was heroically saved by Geoff and Vandarith during the centipede attack on the Unstable Bridge.
* **Gully:**
  * **Status:** Active.
  * **Description:** Gaunt human shopkeep, runs "Gully's Tackle" in The Maw, a grimy shop dealing in fishing equipment and scavenged goods.
  * **History:** Purchased Hestor Fairwind's magical oar from the party for 175 GP. Agreed to give the party a cut if a future buyer mentions their name. Provided the initial lead to Silas "Slick" Fenn when Vincent inquired about underworld connections for selling slaves/accessing The Hollow.
* **Inquisitors - Sera Valen & Kaelis Varr:**
  * **Status:** Active, likely investigating the party and the disturbances.
  * **Description:** (As detailed under Factions). Sera is the stern leader (Knight archetype, glaive, minor divine items); Kaelis is the silent VR-marked enforcer (Gladiator archetype, greatsword, anti-undead tools).
  * **History:** Confronted the party in Fishgut Alley. Their attempt to apprehend the party was thwarted when Geoff used Acolyte Isshara as a human shield against Sera Valen's divine smite, resulting in Isshara's explosive death and allowing the party to flee in the ensuing shock and horror. They are almost certainly now actively hunting the party, viewing them as dangerous, depraved abominations.
* **Kaelen (Sentient Artifact):**
  * **Status:** Active, bound to [Geoff's](#geoff-wembley) chosen weapon (though full ritual at Ebony Stair pending).
  * **Description:** The spirit of one of Malrik the Deathless's powerful undead lieutenants. Communicates telepathically with Geoff, his voice cold, arrogant, and resonant with ancient power and malice.
  * **History & Goals:** Awakened fully after the sacrifice of Isshara and subsequent soul absorptions (Rork's crew, Ashen Veil, Giant Spiders). Hungers for souls (especially potent or defiant ones) to regain his former power and empower Geoff. Guides Geoff towards the **Ebony Stair** in The Hollow for a full bonding ritual that will unlock Geoff's Eldritch Knight potential and further Kaelen's own agenda. Ultimately seeks the **Necrotic Heart**, believing it can resurrect Malrik or grant him god-like necromantic power. Offers tactical advice, historical context (often glorifying Malrik), and constantly pushes Geoff towards violence and soul consumption.
* **Lyraelle, the Twilight Bloom (Vincent's Patron):**
  * **Status:** Active, communicating (with difficulty) with [Vincent](#vincent-martinelli).
  * **Description:** (Appears to Vincent as an ethereal, captivatingly beautiful fey of shadow and twilight, her form often wreathed in blooming night-flowers and subtle illusions). Secretly a manipulative and powerful **Hag**.
  * **History & Goals:** Her connection to Vincent and her ability to "see" into Duskhaven are significantly disrupted by magical interference, particularly strong in The Hollow. The demise of the local Ashen Veil cell (manipulated by Lilith) has slightly cleared this interference. She directs Vincent to find and eliminate all sources of this disruption and to find and rally any surviving **Shadowed Veil** members to rebuild the organization under his (and by extension, her) influence, promising him power and rewards. Her true motives for wanting unfettered access to Duskhaven are unknown to Vincent, but likely involve seizing power or corrupting key locations/individuals. She was responsible for getting Vincent out of his initial jam (imprisonment after Briarhallow) in Session 1.
* **Mara Vane (Shadowed Veil Remnant Leader - *About to be encountered*):**
  * **Status:** Active, rumored to be hiding near the Old Cistern.
  * **Description:** (Human Spy stats). Presumed to be a wary, pragmatic, and skilled survivor leading a very small, desperate cell of Shadowed Veil remnants (Korbin - Thug; Elara - Bandit/Spy have been suggested as her companions). Represents Vincent's best lead for rebuilding his former organization.
* **Elemental Sprites (For Vandarith):**
  * **Trickle (Water Sprite - The Murky Droplet):**
    * **Status:** Active, subtly accompanying [Vandarith](#vandarith).
    * **Description:** Appears to Vandarith as a floating, teardrop-shaped globule of murky, oily water, about the size of his head. Communicates in gurgling whispers and empathic waves of pain/relief.
    * **History:** Met by Vandarith at the Polluted Drainage Culvert ("Maw-Pipe"). Vandarith completed its quest ("Filter the Flow") by having Geoff help filter a particularly toxic inflow pipe with Yellow Lung fungus skin. Trickle expressed gratitude and its presence now follows Vandarith, felt as a cool dampness, its whispers (like faint rain or dripping) understood only by him. It has expressed clear animosity towards the city's defilement of water and blames other elements for contributing to its plight.
  * *(Others - **Flicker (Fire - The Grumpy Ember)**, **Rumble (Earth - The Scooting Stone)**, **Gust (Air - The Anxious Breeze)**, **Jolt (Lightning - The Gilded Cage Spark)** - Vandarith has sensed the general suffering of these elements or seen their environmental effects (like the fire Vandarith fed in the Brotherhood camp, which pleased the unseen Flicker). He has not yet had direct, conscious interaction with them or undertaken their specific quests. Their distinct forms, personalities, specific locations, quests, and potential utility are DM lore, ready for reveal when Vandarith encounters their dedicated manifestation points throughout Duskhaven.)*
* **Deceased Recently (Sessions 1-9):**
  * **Acolyte Isshara:** (Lizardfolk). Former Marshlight survivor. Sacrificed by Geoff as a human shield against Inquisitor Sera Valen's divine smite in Fishgut Alley (Session 8).
  * **Rork and his Hollow Brotherhood Thugs (approx. 3-4):** Killed by the party and Finnick at their checkpoint in The Hollow (Session 9).
  * **Ashen Veil Initiates (3):** Manipulated into ritual suicide by Lilith at their shrine in The Hollow (Session 9).
  * **Hestor Fairwind:** (Human Ferryman). Killed by Vandarith on the Maw docks after the party stole his ferry (Session 8).
  * **Silas "Slick" Fenn:** (Gnome Informant). Fled during the Inquisitor confrontation in Fishgut Alley (Session 8). His current fate is unknown, but he is not with the party.
  * **Giant Spiders (2):** Killed by the party at the sewer grate entrance to The Hollow (Session 8).
  * **Giant Centipedes (4):** Killed by the party at the Unstable Bridge leading to the Old Cistern (Session 9).
  * **Old Jaska:** (Human Cheese Merchant from prison wagon). Killed by Lilith in Session 1.
  * **Prison Wagon Guards (2):** Killed by party during escape in Session 1.
  * **Ardin Claymoor & Ebon Syndicate Smugglers (Marshlight):** Killed by party in Session 3.
  * **Sgt. Caltwell & Guard Selman (Marshlight Guard Survivors):** Killed by party in Session 6.
  * **Guard Relis (Marshlight Guard Survivor):** Killed by Geoff in Session 6 (fed to Kaelen).
  * **Sovereign Narshka & Shaman Zathaar (Marshlight Lizardfolk Leaders):** Presumed deceased in the flood of Marshlight (Session 5).

## **IV. Player Characters (Current Status - End of Session 9, At Unstable Bridge leading to Old Cistern)**

**Geoff Wembley**

* **Current Location:** The Hollow, at the Unstable Bridge leading towards the Old Cistern, having just defeated Giant Centipedes with the party and heroically rescued Finnick.
* **Primary Objective:** Follow Kaelen's insistent guidance to locate the **Ebony Stair** within The Hollow. Kaelen has promised that a ritual there will fully bond their essences, unlocking Geoff's true potential as an Eldritch Knight and significantly empowering Kaelen.
* **Secondary Objectives/Motivations:** Continue to feed Kaelen souls to strengthen the artifact and himself, viewing this as a necessary path to power. Seek vengeance against the Ebon Syndicate for his betrayal. Understand the full nature and vast power of Kaelen and, by extension, Malrik the Deathless.
* **Recent Key Actions & Developments (Session 9):**
  * Kaelen's voice is now a constant, clear presence, offering advice and demands.
  * Witnessed Lilith's manipulation of the Ashen Veil cultists.
  * Participated in the decision to have Finnick guide them towards the Old Cistern, as Kaelen indicated the Ebony Stair might be accessible via deeper tunnels connected to it.
  * Survived the Yellow Lung fungal spore cloud (after initially triggering it and being affected).
  * Showed ingenuity by realizing the Yellow Lung fungus skin could be used as a filter, aiding Vandarith in completing Trickle's quest.
  * Displayed incredible bravery and acrobatic skill during the chasm bridge collapse and Giant Centipede fight, launching himself into the chasm to save Finnick, coordinating the rescue with Vandarith. His owl familiar provided a vital distraction.
* **Key Possessions:** **Kaelen** (sentient artifact, now fully communicative, currently a shard/focus that will bond to his chosen weapon at the Ebony Stair), standard fighter gear (Level 3 Eldritch Knight, with access to basic spells/features but awaiting full awakening).
* **Mental State:** Increasingly empowered by and reliant on Kaelen's dark influence, rationalizing his violent actions as necessary steps towards achieving the power Kaelen promises. Focused intently on reaching the Ebony Stair. The recent heroic rescue of Finnick might show a lingering spark of his former self, or perhaps a pragmatic understanding of the value of a skilled guide, or even a subconscious desire to prove his strength and worthiness to Kaelen through daring acts. He is becoming comfortable with Kaelen's demands for souls.

**Lilith Agnar**

* **Current Location:** The Hollow, at the Unstable Bridge, having just defeated Giant Centipedes and witnessed Geoff's daring rescue.
* **Primary Objective:** Seek bloody vengeance on the "VR" Inquisitors (specifically the one who killed Jezebel). Exploit her unique Daywalker ability (understood as a blessing/protection from Valtheris) and her Trickery Domain powers to gain personal power and sow widespread chaos throughout Duskhaven.
* **Secondary Objectives/Motivations:** Understand the full extent and potential of Valtheris's subtle blessings. Enjoy the thrill of manipulation, the fear she instills, and the destabilization of established order. Test the limits of her vampiric and divine powers.
* **Recent Key Actions & Developments (Session 9):**
  * Finished off the wounded Hollow Brotherhood leader Rork by feeding on him, a satisfying display of predatory dominance.
  * Masterfully and chillingly manipulated three Ashen Veil cultists into committing ritual suicide upon their own altar, a significant demonstration of her cunning, her chaotic evil alignment, and Valtheris's approving influence.
  * Was affected by Yellow Lung spores due to her morbid curiosity but recovered.
  * Survived the chasm bridge crossing and the subsequent Giant Centipede fight, likely using her agility and shadow skills.
* **Key Possessions:** Trickery Domain Cleric abilities (Level 3), Daywalker vampire traits (understands this as a unique boon from Valtheris that allows her to resist the Sunshield Ward), standard cleric gear. **She has no knowledge of a lost sibling (Avanar Voss) or any associated mystery regarding her family past beyond the trauma of Ironmoor.**
* **Mental State:** Feeling confident, highly empowered, and relishing her ability to cause chaos and manipulate others. Her success with the Ashen Veil has likely emboldened her. Her primary focus remains hunting the "VR" Inquisitors and undermining any semblance of "holy" order or authority in Duskhaven. The suffering and desperation of The Hollow are likely viewed as an amusing playground for her talents.

**Vincent Martinelli**

* **Current Location:** The Hollow, at the Unstable Bridge, heading towards the Old Cistern.
* **Primary Objective:** Investigate and neutralize the magical interference within Duskhaven (particularly The Hollow) that is weakening his Patron **Lyraelle's** connection to him and her ability to "see" into the city. Find and rally any surviving members of the **Shadowed Veil** to rebuild the organization under his leadership.
* **Secondary Objectives/Motivations:** Gain personal power and influence in Duskhaven's underworld, establishing his "mafia." Serve Lyraelle effectively to gain greater rewards and understanding of her true (still unknown to him as a Hag) plans.
* **Recent Key Actions & Developments (Session 9):**
  * Was critically wounded by Rork's crossbow bolt during his attempt to negotiate/intimidate the Brotherhood thugs.
  * Effectively used his Sleep spell to incapacitate three of Rork's thugs, turning the tide of the fight.
  * Witnessed Vandarith and Geoff offering the bodies of their slain foes to a brazier fire. Seeing the positive reaction of unseen fire spirits (Flicker), Vincent pragmatically added the remaining unconscious/dead thugs to the pyre as his own "offering" to potentially curry favor with local minor powers.
  * Witnessed Lilith's chilling manipulation of the Ashen Veil cultists. Lyraelle confirmed to him that their death rituals were indeed *part* of the interference blocking her.
  * Successfully navigated the Yellow Lung spore cloud.
  * Survived the chasm bridge crossing and the Giant Centipede fight.
* **Key Possessions:** Archfey Warlock abilities (Level 3, Lyraelle is Patron, Pact Boon chosen), knowledge of old Shadowed Veil codes/practices, standard warlock gear. Finnick serves as his (and the party's) guide. **He has not yet encountered or recruited any Shadowed Veil survivors, including Mara Vane.**
* **Mental State:** Driven to serve Lyraelle (due to past obligation for her "saving" him in Session 1, and the promise of future rewards/power). Eager to find any Veil traces in the Old Cistern and to confront further Ashen Veil interference as per Lyraelle's directive. He is actively assessing The Hollow for opportunities to build his own power base and is likely feeling the pressure of his Patron's expectations, especially now that her connection has slightly improved.

**Vandarith**

* **Current Location:** The Hollow, at the Unstable Bridge, heading towards the Old Cistern.
* **Primary Objective:** Driven by an intense, almost fanatical obsession (massively fueled by his 3000-year elemental-deprived banishment in the Astral Plane) with the interplay of elements and their profound suffering due to civilization, particularly the blight that is Duskhaven. He seeks to understand his newly awakened ability to perceive these elemental spirits, communicate with them (currently understanding their emotional intent and basic desires), and potentially aid them in finding balance or freedom from their corruption by the city. He holds a deep dislike for how humanity obstructs or taints raw elemental forces.
* **Secondary Objectives/Motivations:** Understand the nature of his own hard-won immortality and his place in this new, drastically changed era after millennia of sensory deprivation. Explore the depths of his elemental connection and power.
* **Recent Key Actions & Developments (Session 9):**
  * Witnessed Rork's demise with grim satisfaction, viewing it as a removal of a brutish obstacle.
  * Took the initiative to offer Rork's thugs' bodies (and later the Ashen Veil cultists' bodies, after Lilith's actions) to a brazier fire, intuitively sensing a positive, almost joyful reaction from unseen fire spirits ([Flicker](#flicker-fire-sprite---the-grumpy-ember), whom he hasn't formally met but whose presence he acknowledged through the offering).
  * Formally met and aided **Trickle (Water Sprite)** at the Maw-Pipe culvert. He plunged into the vile water to better sense its distress, and with Geoff's ingenious use of Yellow Lung fungus skin as a filter, they successfully completed Trickle's quest ("Filter the Flow"). Trickle now subtly accompanies him, its presence felt as a cool dampness, its gurgling whispers (like faint rain or dripping) understood by Vandarith as expressions of pain and animosity towards the city.
  * Survived the Yellow Lung spores using his monk abilities (Way of Four Elements wind manipulation) to clear a path for himself and aid in Lilith's rescue.
  * Played a key role in the chasm bridge rescue by anchoring Geoff with his own body as Geoff saved Finnick from falling into the centipede-infested abyss.
* **Key Possessions:** Way of the Four Elements Monk abilities (Level 3), Zathaar's Trident (currently appears as a mundane spear to him), heightened elemental perception (can see/feel/understand basic emotional intent and simple communications from spirits like Trickle).
* **Mental State:** Intensely focused on the elemental presences and their profound suffering. The successful interaction with Trickle has solidified his desire to understand and help these entities. His ancient perspective (3000 years old, from another era) makes him view Duskhaven as a temporary, albeit deeply offensive, wound upon a much older elemental world. His actions (killing Hestor, the ritualistic burning of bodies as offerings) show a pragmatic, perhaps detached or even cruel, side when his goals or sense of elemental "justice" are involved. The Old Cistern, with Finnick's mention of "sad water" and "rumbling ground," is a strong draw for him.

---

## **V. Current Key Items & Concepts**

1. **Geoff's Artifact (Kaelen):** A sentient artifact, confirmed to be the spirit of **Kaelen**, one of Malrik the Deathless's former powerful undead lieutenants. It is currently a shard/focus that Kaelen intends to fully bond with Geoff's chosen weapon via a ritual at the **Ebony Stair**. Kaelen communicates telepathically with Geoff, is arrogant, hungers for souls (especially potent or defiant ones) to regain his power and empower Geoff, and offers tactical advice, historical context (often glorifying Malrik), and pushes Geoff towards violence and dominance. He is aware of Malrik's legacy and the **Necrotic Heart**. Currently grants Geoff Temporary Hit Points upon significant soul consumption and has provided visions.
2. **Zathaar's Trident:** Possessed by Vandarith. Recovered from the wreckage of Marshlight Crossing, formerly belonging to Shaman Zathaar. Its specific properties, if any beyond being a mundane spear, are yet to be determined, but its history with a lizardfolk shaman might hold undiscovered connections to nature, water magic, or illusion. It has not yet shown any special reaction for Vandarith.
3. **Party Resources:**
    * **Coin:** 175 GP remaining from the sale of Hestor's magical oar.
    * **Transport:** A stolen (but functional) ferry raft, currently moored (presumably hidden by Vincent) somewhere in The Maw district of Duskhaven. It no longer has its magical oar.
    * **Gear:** Standard adventuring gear for each character, plus any minor items looted from Rork's crew or the Ashen Veil shrine (DM to specify if anything notable was found beyond basic cultist/thug equipment, like the bone fetishes or the tattered Veil note).
    * **Guide:** Finnick the Scavenger.
    * **Elemental Companion (Vandarith):** Trickle, the Water Sprite (invisible to others, communicates with Vandarith via water sounds/empathy).
4. **The Necrotic Heart (Malrik's True Power Source/Phylactery):** (DM Lore, Kaelen is aware). An artifact of immense necromantic power, hidden deep beneath Duskhaven. It is the true source of Malrik's undying essence and a key to his potential return or the empowerment of his legacy. Its subtle leakage of energy contributes to The Hollow's corruption.
5. **The Sunshield Ward (Duskhaven's Defense):** (DM Lore, party is becoming aware of its effects through observation and Lilith's unique interaction). A Gilded Spire-based city-wide abjuration ward designed to suppress powerful undeath and necromantic energies. It is a major magical defense for Duskhaven. Lilith's Daywalker ability, blessed by Valtheris, allows her to uniquely resist its suppressive effects. Its stability might be linked to the Order of the Redeemed's activities and power.

## **VI. Campaign Timeline (Session Summaries)**

### **Session 1: Escape from the Wagon**

PCs awoke chained in a prison wagon bound for Duskhaven for a "show trial." Flashbacks established their individual capture circumstances: Geoff's betrayal by the Ebon Syndicate during the razing of Briarhallow; Lilith's clinic in Briarhallow attacked, Jezebel slain by a "VR" Inquisitor, Lilith captured; Vincent's Shadowed Veil ritual in Briarhallow disrupted by Vandarith's arrival from the Astral Plane, both subsequently captured. The convoy was attacked by an unseen swamp threat, allowing the party to escape custody after a bloody fight where they killed guards and Old Jaska (merchant).

### **Session 2: Swamp Trek & Shelter**

The party, having escaped with minimal supplies and two horses, navigated the treacherous swamp towards Duskhaven by night. They overcame minor environmental hazards (quicksand, vines) and fought Bog Frogs. They found the abandoned, derelict "Cattail Rest" inn, providing minimal shelter. They briefly encountered Arnin Rook, a route clearer, learning some local hazards. Session ended with the first sighting of Marshlight Crossing.

### **Session 3: Marshlight Mayhem**

Arriving at Marshlight Crossing, the party noted the tension between the Duskhaven Guard detachment and the local lizardfolk tribe, and the inactive ferry. Geoff dealt with extortion at the Watchtower. Vincent located Ebon Syndicate members (Geoff's betrayers, including Ardin Claymoor) in the Old Storehouse and tricked them into handing over Geoff's Artifact (then a mysterious shard). The party then ambushed and killed these Syndicate members. Lilith fed on the bodies. Geoff reclaimed his artifact. Lilith was later knocked unconscious by a divine burn from touching magically tainted swamp water. An alligator attack was thwarted. The session ended with the party injured in the unsafe storehouse.

### **Session 4: Factions and Foreshadowing**

Lilith recovered, feeling a power surge. Vincent contacted his patron, Lyraelle, who directed him towards The Hollow in Duskhaven to investigate interference with her connection. Geoff's artifact began to whisper, demanding souls and hinting at Duskhaven's importance. Vandarith investigated the Overgrown Shrine, observing Shaman Zathaar's illusion ritual and sensing instability in a relic Zathaar used. The party discovered suspicious human and crocodile bodies near the shrine. They attended a lizardfolk fire festival, witnessing conflicting speeches from Shaman Zathaar (pro-peace/trade) and Sovereign Narshka (anti-outsider). Vandarith presented a glasswork tribute to Narshka, who received it with cautious respect. Both leaders requested meetings the next morning, each promising passage to Duskhaven in exchange for aid.

### **Session 5: The Drowning of Marshlight**

Following intuition and observed relic instability, Lilith and Vandarith discovered a hidden cavern system beneath Marshlight containing an elemental rift chamber mirroring the Overgrown Shrine. By manipulating ritual pillars within this chamber, they deliberately and catastrophically unleashed the elemental plane of water through the rift. A massive flood surged forth, accompanied by a stampede of hippos from the Hippo Lagoon, completely destroying Marshlight Crossing. Geoff and Vincent, elsewhere at the time, narrowly escaped the deluge. Lilith and Vandarith remained at the epicenter, experiencing surges of shadowy and elemental power respectively. By the time the waters calmed, Marshlight was gone, its inhabitants presumed dead.

### **Session 6: Wreckage and Departure**

Vincent and Geoff returned to the submerged wreckage of Marshlight. Geoff killed the wounded Guard Relis, feeding his soul (and residual souls from the flood) to his artifact. This caused a Will-o'-Wisp to manifest, which they fought. Vandarith reappeared (having survived the flood) and helped destroy the Wisp. A brief Fey rift opened, allowing Vincent's patron Lyraelle to contact him again, reiterating her severed connections in Duskhaven and urging him there. Vandarith recovered Shaman Zathaar's Trident from the wreckage. Lilith Agnar had vanished without a trace. The remaining three (Geoff, Vincent, Vandarith) located the damaged ferry and ferryman Hestor Fairwind, along with two other Duskhaven Guard survivors: Sgt. Caltwell and Guard Selman. Discovering the guards' plan to betray them and seize the ferry, the party fought and killed Caltwell and Selman (Vandarith was knocked unconscious during this fight). Acolyte Isshara, a lizardfolk survivor who had initially fought alongside the guards, offered a truce after witnessing the party's victory. The session ended with Geoff, Vincent, the unconscious Vandarith, Isshara, and Hestor departing north towards Duskhaven on the damaged raft.

### **Session 7: Arrival in the Maw**

The party traveled north towards Duskhaven on the raft. During a fierce storm, Lilith inexplicably reappeared aboard the raft, with no memory of how she got there; her first act was to heal the critically wounded Vandarith. Geoff learned to use Hestor's magical oar (which propelled the raft) and skillfully forged docking papers to ensure a discreet arrival. He also crafted a potent sleeping poison. Upon reaching The Maw docks in Duskhaven, Vincent used the forged papers to deceive the dock guards. Once landed, he threatened Hestor Fairwind at knifepoint, forcing him to abandon the ferry, which the party effectively stole. Geoff and Vandarith then lured Acolyte Isshara below deck, where Vandarith beat her and Geoff force-fed her the sleeping poison, knocking her unconscious. They sold Hestor's magical oar to Gully at "Gully's Tackle" for 175 GP. Seeking connections to sell Isshara into slavery and access The Hollow, Gully directed them to Silas "Slick" Fenn. After Vincent used herbs to calm the paranoid Silas in Fishgut Alley, Silas accepted payment and gave them directions to a sewer entrance to The Hollow near an old fish-packing warehouse. The session ended on a cliffhanger as two heavily armored Inquisitors of Duskhaven (Sera Valen and Kaelis Varr) confronted the party during their conversation with Silas.

### **Session 8: Web of Decay & Descent**

The party faced the Inquisitors (Sera Valen & Kaelis Varr) in Fishgut Alley. To create a diversion and out of sheer brutality, Geoff used the unconscious Acolyte Isshara as a human shield against Sera Valen's divine smite. The holy magic reacted violently with Isshara, causing her to explode in a shower of gore. The act shocked the Inquisitors, providing a window for the party to flee. Geoff's artifact, Kaelen, reacted ecstatically to this potent death, granting Geoff temporary vitality and a clearer vision directing him to the **Ebony Stair** in The Hollow, and Kaelen fully introduced himself. The party (now definitively without Isshara) fled into the Maw's alleys, evading pursuit from the Inquisitors. Silas Fenn also fled.
Reaching the docks again, a beggar approached Geoff – it was Hestor Fairwind, now destitute. As Geoff's bloodlust (influenced by Kaelen) began to show, Vandarith swiftly and brutally killed Hestor by crushing his chest.
The team regrouped and made their way to the abandoned fishery near the sewer grate entrance to The Hollow. Discovering the grate was covered in thick, unnatural cobwebs, they were ambushed by two Giant Spiders. After a fierce skirmish, they defeated the spiders, and Kaelen absorbed their life force with minor satisfaction. The session ended as the party stared down into the dark shaft leading to The Hollow, ready to descend.

### **Session 9: The Taste of the Underbelly**

The party descended into The Hollow. Vandarith's elemental senses fully awakened, allowing him to perceive the suffering of the environment and see fleeting manifestations of water spirits at the entrance, which Lilith and Vincent also glimpsed. Kaelen urged Geoff towards the Ebony Stair. Lyraelle's connection to Vincent was noticeably weaker.
Guided by Finnick the scavenger (rescued from Rork's crew in the previous session's unplayed encounter, his stabbing of Rork making him an ally), they navigated initial tunnels. They encountered a cavern filled with "Yellow Lung" fungi; Geoff's insight into its nature was ironically followed by him and Lilith (due to curiosity) triggering spore bursts, requiring Geoff and Vandarith (using wind) to rescue a choking Lilith.
They reached the "Maw-Pipe," a foul drainage culvert. Vandarith, driven by empathy, plunged into the sewage and made first contact with **Trickle**, a water sprite. Understanding its plea, Geoff devised a filter from Yellow Lung fungus skin, which he successfully applied to the toxic inflow pipe, aiding Trickle. Trickle expressed gratitude and now subtly accompanies Vandarith.
Their journey continued to the Old Stone-Span bridge over a chasm. Their crossing alerted four Giant Centipedes. During the fight, Finnick was grabbed. Geoff heroically dove down the chasm wall, Vandarith struck the centipede freeing Finnick (who then fell), Geoff caught Finnick mid-air while Vandarith anchored Geoff, and they swung Finnick to safety. The party then dispatched the remaining centipedes. The session ended with the party, battered but successful, at the threshold of the Old Cistern.

## **V. Travel Notes (Duskhaven Region & Dominion)**

* **Scale:** The Cymrath Dominion is roughly 600-800 miles across (similar to a small subcontinent).
* **Major Routes (Approximate Distances/Times):**
  * Duskhaven to Eldwyne (West Coast): ~250-300 miles (Travel Time: ~2-3 weeks by foot, ~7-10 days by coastal boat).
  * Duskhaven to Ironmoor (Far North): ~400-500 miles (Travel Time: ~1 month by foot through potentially difficult terrain).
  * Duskhaven to Veilcairn (Southern Expanse): ~300-400 miles (Travel Time: Varies significantly due to arid/desert terrain).
* **Difficulties:**
  * **Infrastructure:** Many roads outside major arteries have decayed since the War of the Deathless. Banditry is common, especially off the main routes.
  * **Barriers:** Travel can be significantly delayed or require detours due to seasonal weather (harsh winters in the north, heavy rains and potential floods in southern/swampy regions).
  * **Necessities:** Long-distance travel typically requires securing adequate supplies, mounts (if affordable/available), and possibly hiring guards for protection.
