Understood! My apologies for the confusion about the session numbering and the extent of their progress. You're absolutely right, we need a Ground Truth document accurate to the *end of Session 9*, which concluded with them about to cross the unstable bridge, having already met Trickle.

Here is the meticulously updated Ground Truth document reflecting all campaign events and character statuses up to the end of Session 9. Session 10's detailed plan for the Old Cistern and Mara Vane will follow this, built upon this corrected foundation.

## **II. World Codex: Eryndral**

### **A. Cosmology & Major Historical Events**

1.  **The World of Eryndral:**
    *   The campaign world, featuring diverse locales, ancient ruins, and lands shaped by conflict and divine influence. Known civilizations reside mainly on one continent and surrounding isles.
    *   **Legends of Origin:** Vary – some claim gods directly shaped Eryndral, while others suggest it formed from the remnants of an older, shattered realm, leaving pockets of wild magic and cursed domains.
2.  **The War of the Deathless:**
    *   A cataclysmic conflict initiated by the necromancer **Malrik the Deathless**.
    *   **Malrik's Rise:** Originally a mortal mage obsessed with conquering death, gained immense power (possibly via the rumored **Black Chalice** artifact) and raised vast undead armies that swept across **The Cymrath Dominion**.
    *   **Phases & Key Events:** Included the *Silent March*, *Nightfall Offensive* (Death Titans), the *Siege of Ironmoor* ([Lilith Agnar](#lilith-agnar) fought/turned here), the *Sorrow of Eldwyne*, the *Black Harvest*, and the *Pact of Duskhaven*.
    *   **The Fall of Malrik:**
        *   **Location:** The **Ashen Vale**.
        *   **Coalition:** The **Heroes of the Vale** – King Aldred the Bold, **Seraphina Lirieth** (Elven Archmage, sacrificed self to destroy Malrik's physical form), Thane Torgrin Stoneheart, and Veyra of the Wilds.
        *   **Mystery:** Malrik's **phylactery was never found**. The exact nature of his ultimate defeat/containment and Seraphina's spell remains somewhat obscured.
    *   **Aftermath:** Ashen Vale cursed. Undead remnants persist. Black Chalice lost. Fears of Malrik's return.
3.  **The Hollow Reconstruction:**
    *   Period after Malrik's defeat. Peace -> corruption/fragmentation.
    *   **Key Events:** *Heroes’ Disbanding*, *The Great Culling* (magic user purges), *The Warlord Boom* (rise of mercenaries like **The Iron Brand**).
    *   **Cultural Memory:** Betrayed promises for commoners, romanticized by nobles.
4.  **The Necrotic Heart (Malrik's True Phylactery/Legacy - *DM Lore, emerging*):**
    *   Malrik channeled his essence into this artifact before his physical form's destruction. Hidden deep beneath future Duskhaven.
    *   Its power *leaks* subtly, corrupting The Hollow, drawing undead.
    *   The **Sunshield Ward** of the Gilded Spire was likely established partly to contain its influence.
    *   **Kaelen** ([Geoff's Artifact](#geoffs-artifact)) is aware of it and seeks it.

### **B. Key World Lore Figures**

1.  **Malrik the Deathless:**
    *   **Status:** Physical Form Destroyed (by Seraphina Lirieth); Essence likely tied to the **Necrotic Heart**; Traditional Phylactery Missing.
    *   **Epithets:** The Pale Sovereign, The Wound of Cymrath, The Harbinger of Silence.
    *   **Legacy:** Instigator of the War of the Deathless. Cults seek his return.

### **C. Religion & Deities (Pantheon of Eryndral)**

*   Reflects hope/despair. **Forgotten Pantheon** followers often deemed cultists.
*   **Lyris:** Goddess of Light and Redemption (Life, Light). Symbol: Sunburst.
*   **Kaelthar:** God of Knowledge and Secrets (Knowledge, Arcana). Symbol: Eye in book.
*   **Durnok:** God of Stone and Endurance (Forge, War). Symbol: Hammer on anvil.
*   **Valtheris:** God of Shadows and Ambition (Trickery, Twilight). Symbol: Obscured crescent moon. ([Lilith Agnar's](#lilith-agnar) deity, her Daywalker ability is a subtle blessing/protection from him).
*   **Myreth:** Goddess of Nature and Change (Nature, Tempest). Symbol: Leaf in ice.
*   **Tormath:** God of Death and Balance (Death, Grave). Symbol: Skeletal hand with scales.
*   **Vorlag, the Suffocating Void (Ashen Veil Deity):** Forgotten entity of entropy, decay, oblivion. Worshipped with sacrifice by the **Ashen Veil**.

*   **Mental State:** Confident, powerful, relishing her ability to cause chaos. Focused on hunting Inquisitors. Her curiosity with the spores shows a reckless streak.

**Vincent Martinelli**

*   **Current Location:** The Hollow, at the Unstable Bridge, heading towards the Old Cistern.
*   **Primary Objective:** Investigate and neutralize the magical interference blocking Lyraelle's connection in Duskhaven. Find and rally Shadowed Veil remnants to rebuild the organization under his leadership.
*   **Recent Actions:** Received Lyraelle's directive. Deceived dock guards, stole ferry, threatened Hestor. Sold oar, got lead to Silas. Critically wounded by Rork, used Sleep spell. Witnessed Vandarith/Geoff burn bodies. Witnessed Lilith's Veil manipulation. Lyraelle confirmed local Veil rituals were part of interference. Navigated Yellow Lung spores successfully.

*   **Recent Actions:** Instrumental in Marshlight's destruction (elemental flood). Healed by Lilith. Killed Hestor Fairwind. Offered Rork's thugs' and Ashen Veil cultists' bodies to a brazier fire (pleasing unseen Flicker).

**Session 10 Plan Segment: Arrival at the Old Cistern & Meeting Mara Vane**

**(The party has just survived the Unstable Bridge and the Giant Centipede attack. Finnick confirms the Old Cistern is just ahead.)**

**III. Arrival at the Old Cistern & Initial Exploration (Focus: Setting the Scene, Minor Discoveries, Leading to Mara) (60-75 minutes)**

1.  **A. Entering the Old Cistern (Visual & Auditory Description):**
    *   **(Read-Aloud: Cistern Description):**
        > "Beyond the chasm and the defeated centipedes, the tunnel finally opens into the **vast, echoing cavern of the Old Cistern**. Massive, crumbling stone pillars, slick with algae, rise from dark, stagnant water to a vaulted ceiling lost in impenetrable shadow far above. The air is heavy with the smell of **ancient mildew and vast, still water**. Rickety wooden walkways, many with gaping holes where planks have rotted away, connect raised stone ledges and partially submerged islands of rubble. The only sounds are the amplified **drip-drip-drip** of water from countless unseen sources and the faint **plop** as something unseen breaks the surface of the black pools below. It feels like a forgotten, drowned cathedral."
        > **Image Gen Prompt:** `Vast, ancient underground cistern, immense stone pillars rising from dark, still water reflecting faint green/blue fungal light. Crumbling wooden walkways. High vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. Sense of immense scale, decay, and forgotten grandeur. Moody, atmospheric fantasy. --ar 16:9 --stylize 800`
        > Finnick shivers, his voice barely a whisper. *"This is it. The Old Cistern. Biggest place I know in the upper Hollow. Easy to get lost. Easy to *be* lost. Folk hide here... or disappear forever. The old stories say the Shadowed Veil used hidden chambers off the main cistern, high up, before... well, before the Ashen Veil got so bold and started snatching folk from even these deep places."*
        > *(Lyraelle to Vincent, her voice clearer but still distant):* *"Yes... the Veil's shadow lingers here... faint, like old perfume on a rotting dress, almost washed away by time and despair. They were masters of secrets, your predecessors. Seek the most defensible shadows, the places where desperate survivors would cling to their last hope. They *must* have left traces... or perhaps... some *are* still here, watching."*
2.  **B. Exploring the Cistern - Points of Interest & Clues (Player Driven Exploration, guided by Finnick if asked):**
    *   The party can choose where to explore. Finnick can offer warnings: *"That side leads to the Deep Drains, full of Gricks they say."* or *"Water's treacherous over there, heard of folks pulled under."*
    *   **POI 1: The Old Pump House (Ruined Machinery & Potential Salvage)** (Image: Colossal pillar, rusted valve).
        *   **(Read-Aloud - Approaching):**
            > "Finnick gestures towards the center of a large, relatively open basin within the cistern, where rickety walkways converge. 'That's the Old Heart-Pillar,' he says. 'Biggest one in the place. Got that ancient valve wheel on it. Nobody knows what it did, or if it even works anymore.'"
        *   **Investigation (DC 16):** Faint magical runes around the valve's housing suggest magical operation/sealing.
        *   **Clue for Vincent/Veil (Intelligence (Investigation) DC 13):** Near the base of the pillar, almost hidden by algae, Vincent (or someone searching carefully) spots a **very faint, almost obliterated scratch mark**. It's an archaic version of a directional **Shadowed Veil trail marker**, pointing subtly towards a less obvious series of ledges.
    *   **POI 2: The Sunken Archway & Murky Depths** (Image: Submerged arch, carved figures).
        *   **(Read-Aloud - Discovering):**
            > "Your light catches on a grand, submerged archway in one of the deeper pools. Carved figures, now eroded and covered in slime, flank its sides. It clearly led somewhere significant, but the passage beyond is now drowned in inky black water."
        *   **Clue (Wisdom (Perception) DC 14):** Fresh scrape marks on the *upper* edge of the archway above the waterline, as if from a grappling hook or rope used to access a higher ledge *near* the arch.
    *   **POI 3: The Fungal Grove & Scavenger's Grave** (Image: Multicolored fungi, crude grave).
        *   **(Read-Aloud - Discovering):**
            > "One large, raised platform is entirely carpeted in a vibrant grove of phosphorescent fungi. In the center is a simple cairn of stones, clearly a grave."
        *   **Critical Clue (Investigation DC 13 at edge of platform):** Find a discarded, good quality waterskin and a recently extinguished torch stub – signs of organized, recent presence using this as a vantage point.
    *   **POI 4: The Whispering Falls** (Image: Mournful waterfall, mist).
        *   **(Read-Aloud - Discovering):**
            > "Finnick guides you to a section where the cistern wall is a sheer drop, covered in slick, dark moss. Here, water cascades down in a thin, mournful waterfall into a mist-shrouded pool. The sound creates strange, overlapping echoes that almost sound like sorrowful whispers."
        *   **Vincent/Lyraelle:** If Vincent meditates here, Lyraelle might grant him a clearer vision: *A shadowed fissure, high on a cliff face, roots dangling, the sound of these same falls echoing distantly from within it. A woman's sharp, grey eyes watching.*
        *   **Vandarith/Trickle:** Trickle reacts strongly here, its gurgles forming more discernible patterns of sorrow or warning about the depths. Vandarith might sense a struggling purity in this water.
3.  **C. Discovery Point: The Concealed Fissure - "The Overlook" (Leading to Mara Vane):**
    *   **Trigger:** After exploring and finding clues (Veil marker, scrapes, recent items, Vincent's vision), Finnick connects them to the "Spider-Crack" legend near the Whispering Falls.
    *   **(Read-Aloud - Finnick spotting/remembering the fissure, leading to the climb challenge - Athletics DC 14).**
    *   **Image Gen Prompt (Fissure):** `High cavern wall in a dark, vast cistern, a narrow, almost invisible fissure hidden behind hanging pale roots and deep architectural shadows. Faint, ancient Shadowed Veil markings near its base on the climbable rock face. --ar 4:5`

**IV. The Parley with Mara Vane & The Path Forward (Focus of the Session's Climax - 60-90 minutes)**

*   **Objective:** Vincent attempts to rally Mara Vane and her Shadowed Veil remnants. This encounter will provide the party's next major objective.
*   **A. Mara's Challenge from the Shadows (As previously detailed):**
    *   *"That's far enough... State your names, your business..."*
*   **B. The Parley:**
    *   **NPCs Revealed:** **Mara Vane** (Spy), **Korbin** (Thug), **Elara** (Bandit/Spy). Their hideout is cramped, defensible.
    *   **(Read-Aloud - Mara Revealed & Initial Dialogue, as previously detailed):**
        > *"We heard the Ashen Veil's local chanters went silent... And Rork's crew won't be bothering anyone again. You've been busy... Who are you, and what do you want with the ghosts of the Shadowed Veil?"*
    *   **Vincent's Negotiation (Core Interaction):** His pitch (rebuild Veil, power from Lyraelle, vengeance on Ashen Veil). Mara's skepticism and potential tests. **Charisma (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation) DC 15-17.**
    *   **Information Revealed by Mara (if Vincent successful):**
        1.  Ashen Veil's major **soul-binding ritual** at the **Sunken Temple in the Bone Orchard sector** (happening *soon* – within 2 days).
        2.  Ashen Veil stole **Shadowed Veil's Hollow Survey Maps** which include routes to the **Ebony Stair**. These maps are likely at the Sunken Temple.
        3.  Her condition for alliance: Strike the Sunken Temple, disrupt ritual, retrieve maps.
    *   **Lyraelle & Kaelen's Reactions (confirming Mara's intel and their own desires for the Temple/map).**
*   **C. Outcome of Parley & Introduction of Rumble:**
    *   **Alliance Forged (Primary Successful Outcome):** Mara Vane and her 2 operatives join Vincent.
        *   **(Read-Aloud: Alliance):** *"Alright, Martinelli. The Veil has bled enough... We'll follow. But lead us wisely."*
    *   **Vandarith & Rumble (Introduction):**
        *   **Trigger:** As Mara describes the "Bone Orchard" and its ground of "compressed bone dust," Vandarith feels a powerful resonance.
        *   **(Read-Aloud - To Vandarith only):**
            > "Vandarith, as Mara speaks of the 'Bone Orchard,' you feel a profound, **heavy groaning sensation** from the stone floor... Visible only to you, **Rumble** manifests – the **small pile of mismatched stones and compacted dust** shuffles agitatedly... Its slow, ponderous thought fills your mind:"
            > *"<Bone... Orchard... Yes... Ground... *weeps* there... They *disturb* the deep sleep... with their... bone-magic... It... hurts... the true earth... Stop... their... defiling... Let the deep earth... *rest*...>"*
        *   **Rumble's Quest ("Silence the Bone-Magic"):** Aligns with hitting the Sunken Temple.

**V. Session End Hook: The Ticking Clock (15-20 minutes)**

*   **Objective:** Establish the urgent next goal for the party.
*   **A. Mara's Briefing on the Bone Orchard & Sunken Temple (Dangers: Grave Scuttlers, rising dead, heavily guarded Temple).**
*   **B. Elara's Urgent News (The Ticking Clock):**
    *   **(Read-Aloud - Cliffhanger, as Elara bursts in with news of the ritual being accelerated):**
        > "As you begin to discuss your approach to the Bone Orchard, Elara, Mara's scout, stumbles onto the ledge, breathless and pale. 'Mara! Word from my contact... the Ashen Veil... they've *accelerated* their ritual at the Sunken Temple! They begin at **next moonrise**! We have to move *now* if we're to have any chance of stopping them and getting those maps!'"
        >
        > "Mara turns to you, her face grim. 'The choice of path to the Bone Orchard is yours – the direct way through the Necropolis Tunnels, or the dangerous detour past Grusk Bone-Knapper in the Serpent Coils. Either way, time is no longer our ally.'"

**(End Session Here)**
