## Geoff Wembley - The Embittered Scribe, Bound to a Dark Legacy

### Background Snapshot

Once a meticulous bookkeeper for the notorious Ebon Syndicate in Duskhaven, Geoff Wembley possessed a sharp mind and a knack for numbers. His role involved "cooking the books," a skill that served his employers well until he uncovered their own internal skimming and deceptions. This discovery led to a brutal betrayal: his Syndicate associates, under orders from higher-ups, left him for dead in a blazing warehouse in Briarhallow during the chaos of its razing by Duskhaven forces. Though he narrowly escaped the inferno, he was captured by Duskhaven soldiers and thrown into a prison wagon, his life shattered, his trust irrevocably broken. Adding a layer to his past, Geoff also possesses rudimentary druidic knowledge, learned from a mysterious figure known only as "The Rootbinder," granting him the Druid Initiate feat. He entered this ordeal seeking vengeance against those who wronged him and perhaps answers about the artifact they were smuggling during his betrayal.

### Campaign Experiences Thus Far

* **Escape & Early Brutality:** Geoff was instrumental in the escape from the prison wagon, demonstrating a pragmatic ruthlessness. His journey through the swamps towards Duskhaven was marked by survival against the elements and minor threats.
* **Marshlight's Fall:** He witnessed the escalating tensions in Marshlight Crossing and ultimately participated in the events leading to its cataclysmic destruction by the elemental flood unleashed by Lilith and Vandarith.
* **The Artifact & Kaelen's Awakening:** In the ruins of Marshlight, Vincent recovered a mysterious artifact from Ebon Syndicate members Geoff recognized from his past â€“ the very item they were likely dealing with when he was betrayed. After Geoff killed the wounded Guard Relis, feeding the artifact his soul, the artifact's power surged, culminating in the manifestation of a Will-o'-Wisp. More significantly, after using the captured Acolyte Isshara as a human shield against an Inquisitor's divine smite in Fishgut Alley (an act of shocking brutality that resulted in Isshara's explosive death), the artifact reacted with ecstatic power. This potent offering fully awakened the sentient spirit within: Kaelen, a lieutenant of the ancient necromancer Malrik the Deathless. Kaelen now communicates directly with Geoff, promising to unlock his true potential as an Eldritch Knight and guide him to the Ebony Stair in The Hollow for a full bonding ritual, all while demanding a constant tribute of souls to fuel their shared power.
* **Duskhaven's Underbelly:** Geoff navigated the treacherous Maw district, using his forged papers to help secure landing, participated in selling Hestor's magical oar, and faced Inquisitors. In The Hollow, Kaelen's influence grew; Geoff coldly executed a sleeping Hollow Brotherhood thug by shoving his head into a brazier, an act Kaelen greatly approved of. He also witnessed Lilith's chilling manipulation of the Ashen Veil.
* **Recent Heroics & Pragmatism:** He cleverly used Yellow Lung fungus skin to help Vandarith aid the water spirit Trickle. During the perilous chasm crossing, he displayed incredible bravery by diving after the falling Finnick, coordinating a desperate rescue with Vandarith. This act stands in stark contrast to his otherwise hardening demeanor under Kaelen's influence.

### Current Goal

Driven by Kaelen's promises and his own desire for vengeance and power, Geoff's primary focus is reaching the Ebony Stair to complete the bonding ritual and further empower himself and his sentient weapon. He is becoming a formidable, if morally compromised, warrior, walking a dark path towards becoming a true Eldritch Knight.

## Lilith Agnar - The Sun-Scorched Wraith, Agent of Chaos

### Background Snapshot

A Drow with a long and tragic past, Lilith fought in the devastating War of the Deathless nearly fifty years ago during the brutal Siege of Ironmoor. Mortally wounded, she was "saved" by the vampire Jezebel, who turned her into one of her kind. For half a century, they drifted, surviving on the fringes. Recently, they had established a precarious existence in the quiet hamlet of Briarhallow, where Lilith ran a small clinic, a thin veneer of service masking her true nature. This fragile peace was shattered when Duskhaven forces, led by a zealous Inquisitor bearing a "VR" symbol, razed Briarhallow. Jezebel was slain before Lilith's eyes by this Inquisitor, and Lilith herself was captured and thrown into the prison wagon. Unbeknownst to most, Lilith is an unusual Daywalker vampire, able to withstand sunlight due to a subtle, perhaps unrecognized, blessing from Valtheris, God of Shadows and Trickery, to whom she has a nascent connection (Trickery Domain Cleric). She has no memory of a lost sibling.

### Campaign Experiences Thus Far

* **Initial Trauma & Escape:** The campaign began with her capture immediately following Jezebel's death. She played a key role in the bloody escape from the prison wagon, notably killing the cheese merchant Old Jaska by feeding on him.
* **Marshlight's Demise:** Lilith was a primary architect of Marshlight Crossing's destruction. With Vandarith, she discovered an elemental rift chamber and deliberately unleashed the plane of water, causing a catastrophic flood that wiped the settlement from existence. During this event, she vanished without a trace.
* **Mysterious Return & Healing:** During the chaotic journey to Duskhaven on the stolen raft, amidst a fierce storm, Lilith inexplicably reappeared, with no memory of how she arrived. Her first act was to use her divine power to heal Vandarith from his critical wounds.
* **Duskhaven's Shadows:** Upon arrival in The Maw, she was present for the dealings and deceptions. In Fishgut Alley, she witnessed the "VR" Inquisitors and their chilling authority. Her Daywalker ability was subtly noted when exposed to filtered surface light in The Hollow, where other undead recoiled.
* **Embracing Chaos & Power:** In The Hollow, she decisively finished off the wounded Hollow Brotherhood leader Rork by feeding, a clear display of her predatory nature. Her most significant act of chaotic evil was masterfully manipulating three Ashen Veil cultists into committing ritual suicide at their own altar, an event that clearly pleased whatever dark forces watch over her and demonstrated her potent manipulative abilities. Her curiosity also led her to be affected by the Yellow Lung spores.

### Current Goal

Driven by a burning desire for vengeance against the "VR" Inquisitor who killed Jezebel, and a growing taste for the power and chaos she can wield through her vampiric nature and Valtheris's subtle blessings. She is actively seeking information on the Order of the Redeemed and looking for opportunities to undermine them and assert her own dark influence within Duskhaven.

## Vincent Martinelli - The Aspiring Shadow Broker, Bound to a Deceptive Bloom

### Background Snapshot

A Tiefling (Chthonic) with a history in the criminal underworld, Vincent was an operative for a syndicate known as the Shadowed Veil. He was on the cusp of a significant promotion, undergoing a secret ritual meant to grant him greater power by making contact with an otherworldly fey entity. However, this ritual was violently disrupted when Vandarith, escaping his eons-long imprisonment in the Astral Plane, grabbed onto Vincent as he was being pulled back to the material world. The contact with the fey being was incomplete, leaving Vincent touched by its power but the pact unsealed. This fey entity appears to him as Lyraelle, the Twilight Bloom, a creature of ethereal beauty and shadow, but is secretly a powerful and manipulative Hag. Lyraelle "saved" Vincent from imprisonment after the Briarhallow incident (where his original ritual likely took place before its destruction).

### Campaign Experiences Thus Far

* **Patron's Guidance & The Interference:** Lyraelle's connection to Vincent (and her ability to perceive Duskhaven) is significantly hampered by some form of magical interference originating within the city, particularly The Hollow. Her primary directive to Vincent is to investigate and neutralize this interference. She also encourages him to find and rally any surviving members of the Shadowed Veil to rebuild the organization under his leadership (and thus, her influence).
* **Arrival and Underworld Dealings:** Vincent was key in navigating the party's arrival in The Maw, using forged papers to deceive dock guards and later threatening Hestor Fairwind into abandoning the ferry, which the party then stole. He successfully negotiated the sale of Hestor's magical oar to Gully for a good price, and from Gully, got the lead to Silas "Slick" Fenn for information on accessing The Hollow.
* **Fishgut Alley & The Hollow:** He used his herbalism knowledge to calm Silas Fenn and obtained directions to the sewer entrance. He witnessed the confrontation with the Inquisitors. Upon entering The Hollow, he immediately felt Lyraelle's connection weaken further, confirming this was the nexus of her problem.
* **Combat & Offerings:** During the fight with Rork's crew, Vincent was critically wounded by a crossbow bolt but effectively used his Sleep spell to incapacitate several thugs. He later observed Vandarith (and Geoff) offering the bodies of their slain foes to a brazier fire, and noting the joyful reaction of unseen fire spirits, Vincent made a similar offering of the remaining bodies, perhaps hoping to curry favor with local minor powers or simply out of a grim pragmatism.
* **Ashen Veil Aftermath:** After Lilith manipulated the Ashen Veil cultists into suicide, Lyraelle confirmed to Vincent that their crude death rituals were indeed part of the interference blocking her.

### Current Goal

Vincent's immediate objective is to find any surviving Shadowed Veil members (rumored to be near the Old Cistern) and to continue investigating and eliminating the sources of Lyraelle's interference, starting with whatever threats or opportunities the Old Cistern presents. He is actively looking to build his own power base and assert his influence in The Hollow.

## Vandarith - The Ancient Monk, Awakened to Elemental Suffering

### Background Snapshot

A High Elf Monk from an era three millennia past. In his time, he was a powerful practitioner who delved deeply into the nature of the elemental planes. His peers, fearing his radical views on elemental power and its interaction with civilization (perhaps a belief that civilization inherently corrupts or cages elemental forces), deemed his philosophies too dangerous. As a cruel punishment, they banished him to the Astral Plane, a realm devoid of the elemental energies he so revered, where he was trapped in timeless, senseless isolation for 3000 years. He somehow retained his immortality during this period. He escaped this void by latching onto Vincent Martinelli during the disruption of Vincent's fey pact ritual.

### Campaign Experiences Thus Far

* **Return and Disorientation:** His re-entry into the world was chaotic, crashing into Vincent amidst the razing of Briarhallow. He is ancient, out of time, and grappling with a world drastically changed.
* **Marshlight's Elemental Unleashing:** Vandarith was a key catalyst in the destruction of Marshlight Crossing. He and Lilith discovered an elemental rift chamber and, through his interaction with its mechanisms, deliberately unleashed the raw power of the Plane of Water, causing the catastrophic flood. This event seems to have profoundly re-attuned him to elemental energies, perhaps dangerously so. He recovered Shaman Zathaar's trident from the wreckage.
* **Journey & Brutality:** After being healed by Lilith on the raft to Duskhaven, he demonstrated a capacity for cold violence by killing the destitute Hestor Fairwind on the Maw docks with a single, devastating blow.
* **Elemental Perception Awakens:** Upon entering The Hollow, Vandarith's senses were overwhelmed by the suffering of the elements. He perceived the very stone groaning and the water swirling with sentient distress, seeing fleeting manifestations of water spirits that even Lilith and Vincent glimpsed when he pointed them out.
* **First True Contact (Trickle):** At the Maw-Pipe culvert, he made conscious contact with Trickle, a water sprite, understanding its pain from the pollution. With Geoff's help using Yellow Lung fungus skin as a filter, Vandarith completed Trickle's request to lessen the flow of a particularly toxic pipe. Trickle now subtly accompanies him, its presence felt as a cool dampness, its gurgling whispers of sorrow and anger at the city understood only by Vandarith.
* **Offerings to Fire:** During the aftermath of the Rork fight, and again after Lilith dealt with the Ashen Veil, Vandarith took the initiative to feed the bodies of their enemies to a brazier/pyre, sensing a positive, almost joyful reaction from unseen fire spirits (Flicker, though he hasn't formally met it yet). This shows his intuitive understanding of elemental needs and perhaps a desire to appease or empower them.
* **Chasm Rescue:** Played a crucial role in saving Finnick (and Geoff) at the Unstable Bridge, his strength and quick thinking vital.

### Current Goal

Driven by his 3000-year elemental deprivation and his newly reawakened (and perhaps amplified) senses, Vandarith is now intensely focused on understanding and interacting with the suffering elemental spirits of Duskhaven. He seeks to comprehend their corruption by the city and perhaps find a way to aid them, driven by a potent mix of empathy, obsessive curiosity, and a deep-seated resentment for how civilization impinges on raw elemental forces. The Old Cistern, with its "sad water" and "rumbling ground," is his next area of keen interest.
