- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] Authentication/authorization if needed

### For New UI Components
- [ ] Follows existing component patterns
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility attributes included
- [ ] Consistent with design system
- [ ] No hardcoded values

### For New Database Tables
- [ ] Proper schema design
- [ ] Foreign key relationships
- [ ] Indexes for performance
- [ ] Data validation constraints
- [ ] Migration strategy planned

### For New CSS Components
- [ ] Uses CSS custom properties
- [ ] Follows BEM methodology
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints included
- [ ] No specificity conflicts
- [ ] Consistent with existing styles

## Maintenance Checklist

### Monthly Reviews
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check accessibility compliance
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Review and update this checklist

### Before Releases
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code review completed

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Run all alignment checks
npm run test:ci

# Run specific test suites
npm run audit                    # Application alignment audit
npm run test:accessibility       # Accessibility testing
npm run test:performance         # Performance monitoring
npm run test:visual              # Visual regression testing

# Development workflow
npm run test:all                 # Core tests + audit + performance
npm run dev                      # Start development server
```

## Common Issues to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Use inline onclick handlers
- Create global functions
- Use !important in CSS
- Skip error handling
- Ignore accessibility
- Hardcode values
- Duplicate existing functionality

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Use data-action attributes
- Use ES6 modules
- Use CSS custom properties
- Implement proper error handling
- Include ARIA attributes
- Use configuration files
- Reuse existing components

## Getting Help

If you encounter alignment issues:

1. Check this checklist first
2. Run the audit script: `npm run audit`
3. Review existing similar features
4. Check the architecture documentation
5. Ask for code review early

## Notes

- This checklist should be updated as the application evolves
- New patterns should be documented here
- Common issues should be added to the "Don't Do This" section
- Performance thresholds should be updated based on real-world usage
